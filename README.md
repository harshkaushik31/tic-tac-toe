### README: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Project Description
This project is an implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It offers two distinct modes of play: a two-player mode for human vs. human matches, and an AI mode where a player can challenge an unbeatable computer opponent. The AI is designed using the Minimax algorithm to play optimally and will always win or draw the game.

## Features
-   A standard 3x3 grid for gameplay.
-   **Two Game Modes:**
    -   **2-Player Mode:** Allows two human players to compete against each other.
    -   **AI Mode:** A single-player experience against an unbeatable computer opponent.
-   Detection of winning conditions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
-   Detection of a draw when all squares are filled.
-   A turn-based system for both game modes.

## How to Play
1.  Choose your desired game mode: 2-player or AI.
2.  In 2-player mode, one player uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'.
3.  In AI mode, you will play as 'O' against the computer's 'X'.
4.  Players take turns placing their mark in an empty square.
5.  The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins the game.
6.  If all nine squares are filled and no one has three marks in a row, the game is a draw.

## Technologies Used
-   **HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript** 
-   **Minimax Algorithm** for the AI opponent, ensuring optimal play.
