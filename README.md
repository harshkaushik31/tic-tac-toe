### README: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Project Description
This project is a classic implementation of the game Tic-Tac-Toe. It allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features
-   A standard 3x3 grid for gameplay.
-   Detection of winning conditions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
-   Detection of a draw when all squares are filled.
-   A turn-based system for two players.

## How to Play
1.  The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2.  One player uses 'X' and the other uses 'O'.
3.  Players take turns placing their mark in an empty square.
4.  The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins the game.
5.  If all nine squares are filled and no one has three marks in a row, the game is a draw.

## Technologies Used
-   Java (or Python, C++, etc., depending on the language used in the code folder)
-   (Add any other relevant technologies, e.g., a specific framework or library)

## How to Run the Project
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe
    ```
3.  **Compile the code:**
    If the project is in a compiled language like Java or C++, you may need to compile the source files. For example, for a Java project:
    ```bash
    javac YourMainFile.java
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    Execute the main file to start the game. For example, for a Java project:
    ```bash
    java YourMainFile
    ```
